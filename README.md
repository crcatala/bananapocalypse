## About

Bananapocalypse! is mumanity's  first attempt at building an HTML5 game. Future updates may allow for more rhyme and reason to the currently non-existent storyline, but in the meantime, all you need to know is that bananas are gross and were likely responsible for the downfall of dinosaurs. Avoid them.
